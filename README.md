1. Tech Stack Overview
   Frontend: React (JavaScript)

Purpose: Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, managing client-side routing, and displaying maps and itinerary information.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Purpose: To create server-side logic and handle API requests for user authentication, itinerary management, and data storage.
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL database)

Purpose: Storing collections of users, itineraries, and other related travel data as JSON-like documents.
Version Control: Git and GitHub

Purpose: For tracking code changes, managing version history, and facilitating team collaboration.
Deployment: Render

Purpose: For deploying both the backend (Node.js server) and frontend (React application) to make the app accessible on the internet.
API Testing: Postman

Purpose: Testing and validating backend API endpoints during development. 2. Tools and Libraries Used
Frontend:
React:

Purpose: A popular JavaScript library for creating single-page applications (SPAs) with reusable components.
Used For: Creating the main structure of the application (Login page, Itinerary Dashboard, Itinerary Form, etc.).
React Router:

Purpose: Library for routing and navigation between different pages in a React app.
Used For: Managing navigation between the Login, Dashboard, and Itinerary pages.
Fetch API:

Purpose: For making HTTP requests to the backend API to retrieve or update data.
Used For: Fetching itineraries, creating new itineraries, registering users, and authenticating.
CSS or Bootstrap:

Purpose: Styling the frontend to improve user experience and visual design.
Used For: Designing responsive UI components like forms, cards, and navigation.
Mapbox or Google Maps API:

Purpose: For displaying and interacting with maps that show activity locations.
Used For: Allowing users to visualize planned activities and key travel locations on an interactive map.
Backend:
Express.js:

Purpose: A lightweight framework for creating RESTful API endpoints.
Used For: Setting up routes for handling user registration, login, itinerary management, and itinerary sharing.
Node.js:

Purpose: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side logic.
Used For: Running the backend application, managing server logic, and processing requests.
MongoDB:

Purpose: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents (collections).
Used For: Storing user details, itineraries, shared itineraries, and activity locations.
dotenv:

Purpose: A Node.js package for securely storing environment variables in a .env file.
Used For: Managing sensitive information like database connection strings, API keys, and secret keys.
Nodemon:

Purpose: Automatically restarts the server whenever file changes are detected during development.
Used For: Improving developer efficiency by avoiding the need to manually restart the server after every change.
Database:
MongoDB:
Purpose: A NoSQL database to store collections as documents with flexible schemas.
Used For:
Users: To store user profiles, login information, and shared itineraries.
Itineraries: To store itinerary details like destination, activities, and dates.
Security:
Environment Variables (.env file):

Purpose: To securely store sensitive information such as database connection URIs, API keys, and authentication secrets.
Used For: Preventing sensitive data from being exposed in the codebase.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Purpose: Middleware in Express to enable cross-origin resource sharing between frontend and backend.
Used For: Allowing the frontend (running on a different domain or port) to interact securely with the backend API.
